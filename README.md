# Alex's Dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles that I use to power my daily-driver desktop. They are subject
to change at any time depending on my current needs, but everything is held in the Git history,
so feel free to look as far back as you need.

Currently, I am running Fedora with AwesomeWM as my window manager of choice!
